## Prisma @@map block attribute

Since postgres likes plural snake_case for the names of its tables, I'll add a @@map block attribute so the actual postgres tables will use the naming convention that makes postgres happy. However, our typescript and prisma will still use the PascalCase system which is how our models will be named.
